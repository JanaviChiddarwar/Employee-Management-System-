Project Overview: This application serves as a comprehensive tool for HR departments to manage employee lifecycles efficiently. It streamlines the process of adding, viewing, updating, and removing employee records through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Key Features & Functionality:

Secure Authentication: A robust Login system to ensure only authorized users can access the management portal.

Dynamic Employee Directory: A "View Employee" module that fetches real-time data into a JTable, featuring a search function by Employee ID.

CRUD Operations: Full capability to Create (Add), Read (View), Update (Modify details like Salary/Designation), and Delete (Remove) employee records.

Automated ID Generation: Integrated a random ID generation logic for new hires to ensure unique identification.

Responsive UX: Includes a professional Splash screen and interactive navigation between modules.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:

Language: Java (Core Java)

GUI Framework: Java Swing & AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)

Database: MySQL

Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Tools: MySQL Workbench, JDBC Driver (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver)

Technical Concepts Implemented:

JDBC API: Established seamless communication between the Java application and MySQL using Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects.

Event Handling: Implemented ActionListener and ItemListener interfaces to handle user interactions (button clicks, dropdown selections).

Exception Handling: Used robust try-catch blocks to manage SQL exceptions and runtime errors.

Layout Management: Utilized "Null Layout" for precise manual positioning of GUI components to create a custom, polished look.

💡 Learning Outcomes:

Deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

Mastered the integration of a relational database with a desktop application.

Gained experience in designing user-centric interfaces and managing application state transitions.
