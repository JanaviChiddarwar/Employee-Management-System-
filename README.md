# Employee Management System

# 💡Project Overview: 
 This application serves as a comprehensive tool for HR departments to manage employee lifecycles efficiently. It streamlines the process of adding, viewing, updating, and removing employee records through an   intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI).

 # 🏢 Key Features & Functionality:
 
 🧑‍💼 Secure Authentication: A robust Login system to ensure only authorized users can access the management portal.
 
 🧑‍💼 Dynamic Employee Directory: A "View Employee" module that fetches real-time data into a JTable, featuring a search function by Employee ID.
 
 🧑‍💼 CRUD Operations: Full capability to Create (Add), Read (View), Update (Modify details like Salary/Designation), and Delete (Remove) employee records.
 
 🧑‍💼 Automated ID Generation: Integrated a random ID generation logic for new hires to ensure unique identification.
 
 🧑‍💼 Responsive UX: Includes a professional Splash screen and interactive navigation between modules.
